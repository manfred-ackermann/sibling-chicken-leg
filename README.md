===================

Just another try to setup a senseful working environment to build a system that
has a Neo4j Graph Database as data sink and node.js as middleware to interface
with humans using a html-interface to

*show the actual network and application situasion so
it's helpful to identify problems and their source*
 
On the node.js side the following extensions are identified to do the job:
- GitHub strongloop/express (Web Development Framework)
- GitHub caolan/async (Async utilities for node and the browser)
- GitHub thingdom/node-neo4j (Neo4j driver (REST API client)) or
- GitHub neo-technology/neo4js (Neo4j REST client for JavaScript)
- GitHub mbostock/d3 (A JavaScript visualization library for HTML and SVG)
- GitHub expressjs/morgan (http request logger middleware)
- GitHub visionmedia/jade (robust, elegant, feature rich template engine)

and last but not least Bootstrap.

That's it ... now let's see how far it get's.
